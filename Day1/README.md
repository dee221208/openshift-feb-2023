## What is Hypervisor?
- aka Virtualization
- Hardware + Software Technology
  General Purpose Processors
  1. AMD - virtualization feature is AMD-V
  2. Intel - Virtualization feature is VT-X
- two types
  1. Type 1 - Meant for Servers/Workstations ( Type 1 hypervisor is directly installed on the Hardware - no OS is required)
  2. Type 2 - Meant for Laptops/Desktops/Workstations( Type2 hypervisor is installed on top of Host OS )
- Examples

  4. Parallels ( Type 2 - Mac OS-X )   
- allows running many Operating System within Virtual Machine side-side i.e many OS can be active on the same system
- each Virtual Machine is allocated with dedicated hardware resources
  - CPU
  - RAM
  - Storage
- hence, this type of virtualization is called as Heavy weight virtualization
- The OS installed with VM/Guest OS is a fully functional Operating Sytem
